### Natural Language Queries

**Book recommendations:**
```
User: I love fantasy novels. Can you recommend some good ones?
Assistant: I'll search our books database for fantasy novels...
[Uses books_query with genre="Fantasy"]
```

**Research assistance:**
```
User: I'm writing a paper on 1950s science fiction. What books from that era are available?
Assistant: Let me find science fiction books from the 1950s...
[Uses books_query with genre="Science Fiction" and year filter]
```

### Complex Workflows

**Planning a book purchase:**
```
User: I want to buy books by Isaac Asimov. The price is $15 USD each. How much would 3 books cost in EUR?
Assistant: 
1. First, let me find Isaac Asimov books...
   [Uses books_query with author="Isaac Asimov"]
2. Now I'll convert $45 USD to EUR...
   [Uses exchange_convert with 45 USD to EUR]
Result: 3 books at $15 each = $45 USD = â‚¬38.35 EUR
```

## API Client Examples

### Python Client

```python
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async def search_books():
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="python",
        args=["-m", "mcp_server.server"]
    )
    
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            
            # Search for science fiction books
            result = await session.call_tool(
                "books_query",
                {"genre": "Science Fiction", "limit": 5}
            )
            print(result.content[0].text)

asyncio.run(search_books())
```

### JavaScript Client

```javascript
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';

const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: 'python',
  args: ['-m', 'mcp_server.server']
});

const client = new Client({
  name: "books-client",
  version: "1.0.0"
}, {
  capabilities: {}
});

await client.connect(transport);

// Convert currency
const result = await client.request({
  method: "tools/call",
  params: {
    name: "exchange_convert",
    arguments: {
      from_currency: "USD",
      to_currency: "EUR", 
      amount: 100
    }
  }
});

console.log(result);
```

## Command Line Examples

### Using MCP Inspector

```bash
# Install MCP Inspector
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector

# Test the server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python -m mcp_server.server
```

### Direct Testing

```bash
# Start the server
python -m mcp_server.server

# Send test requests (manual JSON-RPC)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | python -m mcp_server.server
```

## Error Handling Examples

### Invalid Book ID

```
User: Get book with ID 99999
Response: Book with ID 99999 not found
```

### Unsupported Currency

```
User: Convert 100 XYZ to USD
Response: Error: Unsupported currency code: XYZ
```

### Invalid Parameters

```
User: Convert "hello" dollars to EUR
Response: Error: Amount must be a valid number
```

## Performance Examples

### Large Dataset Queries

```
User: Show me all books (no limit)
Response: [Returns paginated results with count information]
```

### Concurrent Requests

```python
# Multiple simultaneous requests
tasks = [
    session.call_tool("books_query", {"genre": "Fiction"}),
    session.call_tool("exchange_convert", {"from_currency": "USD", "to_currency": "EUR", "amount": 100}),
    session.call_tool("books_query", {"author": "Tolkien"})
]

results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

## Integration Patterns

### Recommendation System

```
User: I liked "Dune". What similar books do you recommend?
Assistant:
1. Let me find books in the science fiction genre...
2. Here are some recommendations from our database...
3. If you're interested in purchasing, I can help with currency conversion for international stores.
```

### Research Workflow

```
User: I'm studying literature from the 1960s. Help me find relevant books and calculate research budget costs.
Assistant:
1. Searching for books from the 1960s...
2. Found X books across various genres
3. Estimating costs in your local currency...
